It seems like you might be asking about saving a file in the text editor "nano." Here is a simple guide on how to do that:

Open nano: To open a file in nano, type nano filename in your terminal. If the file doesn't exist, nano will create it.

Edit your file: Make your changes or write your text in the nano editor.

Save the file:

Press Ctrl + O (which stands for "write Out") to save the changes you made.
Nano will prompt you to confirm the file name. If you are happy with the name, press Enter.
Exit nano:

Press Ctrl + X to exit the editor.
