Minikube itself does not come with a built-in container registry. However, it provides the ability to run a local Docker registry within the Minikube cluster for development and testing purposes.

To set up a local Docker registry in Minikube, you can follow these steps:

Start Minikube:

minikube start

Enable the Ingress addon:

minikube addons enable ingress

Deploy a Docker registry:

kubectl create namespace registry
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/baremetal/deploy.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vaijab/1d7be9712edc4d89a289edb7bdc3f6b4/raw/1d7be9712edc4d89a289edb7bdc3f6b4/registry.yaml

Expose the registry:

kubectl port-forward --namespace registry svc/registry 5000:80

After setting up the local registry, you can push and pull images to it using the address localhost:5000.

Please note that these steps are intended for development and testing environments and may not be suitable for production use. For production, it's recommended to use a more robust solution like Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, or another cloud-based container registry service.
