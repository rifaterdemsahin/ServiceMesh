## Debugging Methods and Tools

1. **Log Analysis**
    - Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to view logs of a specific pod.
    - Check application logs for errors and warnings.

2. **Pod Status**
    - Use `kubectl get pods` to check the status of all pods.
    - Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` for detailed information about a specific pod.

3. **Service Mesh Dashboard**
    - Access the Istio dashboard using `istioctl dashboard kiali` to visualize service mesh traffic and identify issues.

4. **Network Policies**
    - Use `kubectl get networkpolicies` to list network policies.
    - Ensure network policies are not blocking traffic between services.

5. **Sidecar Injection**
    - Verify sidecar injection using `kubectl get pods -o jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.containers[*].name}' | grep istio-proxy`.

6. **Port Forwarding**
    - Use `kubectl port-forward <pod-name> <local-port>:<pod-port>` to forward a port and access the application locally.

7. **Exec into Pod**
    - Use `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash` to open a shell in a running pod for troubleshooting.

8. **Resource Usage**
    - Monitor resource usage with `kubectl top pods` and `kubectl top nodes`.

9. **Configuration Validation**
    - Validate Kubernetes configurations using `kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f <your-config>.yaml`.

10. **Service Connectivity**
    - Test service connectivity using `curl` or `ping` commands within the pod.

11. **Event Logs**
    - Check Kubernetes events with `kubectl get events` to identify issues related to resource creation and scheduling.

12. **Istioctl Analyze**
    - Use `istioctl analyze` to analyze the Istio configuration and detect potential issues.

13. **Debugging Tools**
    - Tools like `kubectl-debug` can be used to debug running containers.

14. **Health Checks**
    - Ensure liveness and readiness probes are correctly configured and check their status with `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`.

15. **Tracing**
    - Use distributed tracing tools like Jaeger to trace requests across services and identify latency issues.

16. **Metrics**
    - Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor metrics and set up alerts for anomalies.

17. **Configuration Management**
    - Use `kubectl diff -f <your-config>.yaml` to see changes between the live configuration and the file.

18. **Namespace Isolation**
    - Ensure namespaces are correctly isolated and there are no cross-namespace issues.

19. **DNS Resolution**
    - Verify DNS resolution within the cluster using `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup <service-name>`.

20. **Service Endpoints**
    - Check service endpoints with `kubectl get endpoints <service-name>` to ensure they are correctly configured.
